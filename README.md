# 3dprinter-dance
Experiments with making a 3d printer "dance" via gcode and python. 

The python script(s) listen to the microphone for sound and try and translate sound into gcode movements. 
Try **choreography-mic.py** from the command line and good luck :D

## Disclaimer
**MESS** The code here is messy, it was produced very fast during a [workshop](https://www.instagram.com/p/DFBHI3SumZL/), and quite honestly I've been procrastinating cleaning it up :D
**BUGS** There is at least one known (logic) bug. The printer gets stuck high, and you need to play it *a lot* of F notes to get it to come down. 

Maybe one day I will clean this up, but until then, enjoy.
